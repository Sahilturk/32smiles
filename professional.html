                <h1 class="heading">Becoming a dentist</h1>
                <h3>Dentists can pursue careers in many different areas.</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>General practice</li>
                    <li>Hospital dentistry</li>
                    <li>Community dentistry</li>
                    <li>Armed forces dentistry</li>
                    <li>Corporate bodies</li>
                    <li>Industry dentistry</li>
                    <li>University teaching and research</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Being a dentist demands diagnostic, clinical and social skills and allows you the unique opportunity to pursue several careers which offer an intellectual and practical challenge as well as a service to society and a respected place in the community. In order to be successful and enjoy this profession, it is essential that you possess good people skills and an interest in their welfare. <br><br>
                    Some dentists will become teachers or lecturers in dental schools, others will be employed in hospitals or community clinics, but most will become general dental practitioners. Often they will be managing a team of people encompassing dental nurses, hygienists, receptionists and others. Good administrative and managerial abilities are required.</p>
                <h2>Dental degree</h2>
                <p> To qualify as a dentist you need to complete a dental course, which usually lasts five years and leads to a bachelor's degree (either BDS or BChD). <br><br>
                    There are four year courses available at Aberdeen, Kings, Liverpool and UCLan dental schools for students with prior qualifications, for example a degree in Biomedical Sciences. <br><br>
                    Dentistry is one of the most popular degrees in the UK and there is lots of competition for places. The Dental Schools Council offers some useful information about different courses and entry requirements.</p>
                <h2>General Dental Council</h2>
                <p>Upon qualification dentists must register with the General Dental Council, the profession's governing body. Dentists must follow ethical guidelines in their dealings with patients and failure to do so may call their continued registration into question.</p>
                <h2>Dental foundation training/vocational training</h2>
                <p>In order to do work in the NHS a dentist must undertake dental foundation training (DFT) or vocational training (VT). This is supervised training, working in an approved practice for one year after graduation. <br><br>
                    After this, there are many different career options open to dentists; for example working in hospitals or community dentistry, however most dentists choose to work in an established practice as an associate. This is as a self-employed dentist, responsible for the treatment that they provide, but working in a practice owned by someone else. <br><br>
                    Once qualified, dentists can continue to update and further their knowledge, through a wide range of short courses and postgraduate qualifications, sometimes on a part-time basis.</p>

                <h1 class="heading">NHS practice</h1>        
                <h3>Saara Sabir, general dental practitioner in Salford outlines her work as a principal for an NHS general practice.</h3>
                <p>As a principal dentist for a four-surgery, NHS, general practice in Salford, Greater Manchester, general practice provides me with the chance to meet and treat patients from a wide socio-demographic background. This means no one day is ever the same.<br><br>
                    The greatest reward of general practice is seeing a patient progressing through their dental journey: from being a high-needs patient who may have initially attended in pain; to a low-needs patient, who has taken on board all the preventive, dietary and brushing instructions they have been given.<br><br>
                    We can be involved in fundamentally changing and improving patients' lives, which is satisfying. Providing good quality care and putting a patient's needs first will result in the practice being trusted in the local community, which is rewarding too.<br><br>
                    General practice allows you to maintain skills in all disciplines of general dental care. Should you decide you want to focus on a particular discipline, there are ever-increasing opportunities to offer more specialist services within primary care, such as sedation or oral surgery.<br><br>
                    There are many challenges involved in NHS general practice and the most notorious is the requirement to complete units of dental activity (UDA) targets and wondering what changes the future contract will bring. <br><br>
                    Running a practice involves the challenges of managing staff, keeping up to date with the increasing administration burden (for example, Care Quality Commission inspections and policies, human resource policies and HTM 01-05) and meeting their associated costs. As dentistry is becoming more consumer-focused and patients increasingly consider themselves to be customers, often shopping around for their dental services, managing their expectations can be challenging, especially when limited by the constraints of the NHS contract.</p>

                <h4>The team analysed 70 primary teeth collected from 70 children enrolled in the Children of the 90s study (also known as the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children) based at the University of Bristol. Parents donated primary teeth (specifically, the pointed teeth on each side of the front of the mouth known as canines) that naturally fell out of the mouths of children aged 5 to 7.</h4>
                <p>During the years following graduation you should aim to gain a broad range of experience and knowledge by completing a variety of training posts. Particularly, completion of foundation training and the MJDF/MFDS examination are likely to be highly important for a successful application to specialist training posts. Additional aspects, such as audit completion, poster presentations, publications and attaining prizes and awards, are all invaluable. This will allow you to build and develop a strong CV for any future career pathway but is particularly important for the competitive arena of specialist training. <br><br>
                    Most specialist training programmes are a minimum of three years and demand a degree of personal and financial sacrifice. You need to choose the right specialty and institution of study and decide whether to study full or part-time. <br><br>
                    On completion of the training programme and passing all the relevant exams, you will be provided with a Certificate of Completion of Specialist Training (CCST) by the General Dental Council. This will give you the opportunity to join the specialist list and use the title ‘specialist’. But this is not the end of the journey: finding and managing the right dental practice and establishing and building your reputation and patient base is just as challenging, if not more, than the training programme itself. <br><br>
                    Once you are established, the rewards of being in control of your time and providing a high standard of care using the latest techniques, equipment and materials, as well as working with other specialist colleagues, will give you immense job satisfaction and help you to enhance and maintain your professional interest over a 40 to 50 year career.</p>
