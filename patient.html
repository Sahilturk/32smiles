            <h1 class="heading">Tooth Decay</h1>
            <h4>Do probiotics prevent gum disease? Is flossing necessary? Many patients are unable to confidently answer these questions and more due to the abundance of conflicting medical information. However, new research led by the University at Buffalo aims to separate fact from fiction in determining which oral hygiene tools actually prevent gum disease.</h4>
            <p>Tooth decay is also referred to as dental caries or cavities. It occurs when the bacteria in plaque is given the chance to settle on teeth. It produces an acid that slowly eats away at the tooth enamel and forms holes. This bacteria is particularly prevalent after eating sugars and starches, so limit exposure by eating a healthy diet. <br><br>
                The likelihood of developing a cavity depends entirely on lifestyle. The better your oral health routine, the less chance you will have of suffering tooth decay. However, older people and children are slightly more at risk, because their enamel is more vulnerable. If a child develops cavities within baby teeth, they will be repaired as soon as the adult teeth emerge, but this does not mean that dental attention isn’t still essential. <br><br>
                The best possible approach to dealing with plaque is prevention. Once you have cavities, there is no real way to reverse them (though new technologies may make this a reality soon). The only option is to fill and repair them, so save your enamel while you still can. Brush and floss regularly, attend routine dental exams, and avoid eating too many sugary foods. <br><br>
                If you are unlucky to develop a cavity, you must have it treated by a dentist. If you leave it to deteriorate, it could progress into an infection or abscess. These conditions cause a lot of pain and discomfort for patients. This is why timely repair procedures are essential, whether they take the form of a standard filling, a crown, or a tooth extraction. The dental code states that extractions should always be a last resort, so it is fairly rare for decayed teeth to be pulled.

            <h1 class="heading">Gum Disease (Periodontitis)</h1>        
                <p>This is a bacterial infection brought about by accumulations of plaque in the mouth. The bacteria eats away at the gum tissue and the ligaments that hold the teeth in place. There are five established stages of gum disease, which means that there is usually plenty of time and opportunities for patients to reverse its progress. <br><br>
                    During the early phases of gingivitis and mild periodontitis, the symptoms can still be reversed with a good dental care routine and immediate treatment for any underlying infections. Once the disease moves on to the third and fourth phases, it becomes much harder to treat, so give yourself the best possible chance and respond early.<br><br>
                    As with cavities, absolutely anybody can develop gum disease. At present, over half of all adults in the US are believed to have some form of gum disease or infection. The most at risk individuals are those with poor dental hygiene, lapsed brushing and flossing techniques, and other serious health problems. For example, patients with diabetes are more prone to developing persistent gum infections.<br><br>
                    If your gums bleed on more than one occasion, you need to consult a dentist. This is the main symptom of gingivitis. The dentist will perform a routine exam by gently probing at the pockets inside the gum tissue. If these pockets bleed or become painful, in response to touching, they are likely to be infected. You may need antibiotics to treat the condition.</p>

            <h1 class="heading">Tooth Infection (Root Infection)</h1>
                <p>This happens when the root (the bottom part) of a tooth becomes infected and fills up with bacteria. It damages the nerves and the pulp tissue inside the tooth itself, if left untreated, so get to the dentist right away if you think that you might have this condition. A deep crack, fracture, or cavity can lead to an infection. <br><br>
                    The most severe root infections cause patients to develop painful abscesses. These appear in the form of very sore facial swellings. However, abscesses usually only occur once a root infection has progressed to a more serious state. If you deal with a painful or cracked tooth quickly, this should not happen.<br><br>
                    The only real solution for a root infection is an affordable root canal treatment. This is quite a complex and lengthy treatment, so it takes a couple of hours to complete. It has a reputation for being very painful, but the reality is quite different. As an anesthetic is always used, patients very rarely feel any pain until after the treatment when the tooth is healing.<br><br>
                    The root canal procedure involves a dentist drilling a hole in the top of the infected tooth. They then insert a special file and grind away at the inside of the tooth until a clear tunnel to the root has been made. Once the passage is open, a suction tool is inserted and used to remove all of the infected pulp tissue and nerves. Finally, the empty tooth structure is filled with a tough material called gutta percha. This prevents bacteria from entering and gives the tooth strength.</p>

            <h1 class="heading">Oral Cancers</h1>        
                <p>Clearly, this is one of the most serious dental problems that you can develop, so it is vital that you recognise the signs as soon as they appear, if they ever do. Most oral cancers begin as a small, pale, pinkish lump or growth inside the mouth. It is almost always painless. If you have a growth like this or you are worried about a change in your mouth, consult a dentist now.<br><br>
                    A specialist will be able to gently examine your mouth, head, and neck for signs of trouble. For smokers, this kind of check-up is very important, because the habit significantly increases the danger of developing mouth cancer. It is also more common in people who drink excessively, so keep an eye on your alcohol consumption.<br><br>
                    The reality is that mouth cancer kills. It has one of the lowest survival rates of all for cancer, primarily because so few cases are caught in the early stages. It is sad to think of how many people could still be alive if they had kept up with routine appointments and exams. Make sure that you never become one of them by making regular visits, keeping a close eye on the health of your mouth, and staying in touch with your dentist.<br><br>
                    Ideally, you do need to stop smoking. This will dramatically decrease your chance of developing the disease. If you try and fail to kick the habit, ask your dentist to screen you for oral cancers at every routine check-up. For cancer, prevention is not just cheaper than the cure. It can mean the difference between life and death. Take care of your mouth and consult your dentist immediately if you spot anything troubling.</p>

            <h1 class="heading">Dry Mouth</h1>
                <p>This condition is sometimes called xerostomia, but it is most easily recognised with the simple term ‘dry mouth.’ Unsurprisingly, it is caused by a lack of saliva in the mouth. This can occur for a number of different reasons, but it is a well-known side effect of taking prescription medications. If you are on any kind of drugs, ask your doctor whether this could be an issue.<br><br>
                 The risky thing about dry mouth is that it robs the gums and teeth of essential moisture, lubrication, and cleansing. Saliva actually has mild antibacterial properties and it is used to wash away residual plaque from teeth. So, without it, bacteria is allowed to remain on the enamel and starts to eat away at it.<br><br>
                The most at risk groups are patients on prescription medications and older people (primarily over the age of fifty). As the mouth ages, saliva production naturally slows and the friction against teeth increases. Over time, if left untreated, this lack of saliva will contribute to the development of decay and cavities.<br><br>
                Unfortunately, there is no direct cure for dry mouth. If medication is the cause, the only guaranteed solution is to stop taking it and this will usually cause a lot more harm. As far as your physical health goes, medications trump your saliva glands in this case. Do not stop taking prescribed meds unless instructed to by your doctor. Sometimes, drinking more water can help with discomfort and parched sensations.</p>

            <h1 class="heading">Enamel Degradation</h1>        
            <p> This is a very common problem and it is characterised by very round and noticeably discoloured enamel surfaces. It occurs as a result of exposure to corrosive materials like fizzy drinks and sugary snacks. The acid in these ingredients wears down the enamel and gives it a stained and unhealthy look. In some cases, overzealous brushing may also be a factor.<br><br>
                The one thing that will lead to enamel degradation faster than anything else is sipping on fizzy and sugary drinks all day, every day. This includes sports drinks, carbonated soft drinks (diet ones too), and most forms of wine. In fact, this is considered to be an occupational hazard for professional wine tasters and reviewers.  <br><br>
                Like cavities, there is only so much that can be done once a certain amount of enamel has been worn away. You cannot get back the material that has been eroded. This means that prevention is always the best cure for enamel degradation. Where possible, swap out soft drinks for water. If you enjoy drinking fruit juices, make sure that you clean your teeth regularly and restrict these drinks to mealtimes.<br><br>
                Your dentist may recommend that you switch to a softer toothbrush, so as not to further erode the enamel. If the surface of teeth are severely damaged, they might require bonding support. In very serious cases, the options will be limited to repairing as much of the damage as possible. The earlier you catch signs of enamel erosion, the better your chances of reversing the process to some degree.</p>
